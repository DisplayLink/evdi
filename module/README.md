# evdi kernel module
When installing DisplayLink software using the provided installer or via distro-provided scripts some required configuration is written. When working with the module manually that configuration will not be created automatically.
This is are various settings fixing issues with compositors (XServer, Gnome/Wayland) likely to cause failure of evdi to discover external DisplayLink devices and lead to much confusion.

See the shell script `dkms_install.sh` and its `evdi_add_mod_options()` function for the steps required.

In summary:

  1. Add module options (nmost importantly `initial_device_count=` )
  2. Auto-load the module

## Module options
Typically `/etc/modprobe.d/evdi.conf` will contain two lines, the second being generated and system-specific:
```
options evdi initial_device_count=4
softdep evdi pre: drm_kms_helper i915
```
Note: `initial_device_count` this is workaround for XServer that builds static lists af attached gpu devices on startup and might crash when gpu device is added dynamically.
Note: `softdep` option tells linux kernel to load evdi driver after primary gpu driver is loaded. This is to ensure that compositor will not attempt to use evdi driver as primary gpu.

## Auto-loading the module
The  `dkms_install.sh` adds the auto-load config in `/etc/modules-load.d/` when it exists. For hosts without systemd the convention for loading modules at start-up is via an entry in `/etc/modules`. `modules-load.d` usually has a symbolic link to this file.

Adding `evdi` to `/etc/modules` enables system to load the driver on boot time.

## Usage
Evdi driver is just kernel space driver that adds virtual displays to the Linux. DisplayLink device enumeration and control is done in binary driver that can be downloaded from https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads/ubuntu.

Alternatively one can manually add outputs with:
```
# echo 1 > /sys/devices/evdi/add
```
and confirm with:
```
$ cat /sys/devivces/evdi/count
```
and when in an Xorg session:
```
$ xrandr --listproviders
Providers: number : 2
Provider 0: id: 0x43 cap: 0x9, Source Output, Sink Offload crtcs: 3 outputs: 2 associated providers: 5 name:modesetting
Provider 1: id: 0x789 cap: 0x2, Sink Output crtcs: 1 outputs: 1 associated providers: 1 name:modesetting
```
Here `Provider 1` is the new output and if things work correctly a new output should appear:
```
$ xrandr --query
...
DVI-I-1-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
```
Once a monitor is detected the resolutions will be reported and GUI tools that manage displays should update to show the newly connected display.
